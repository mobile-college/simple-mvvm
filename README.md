# Introduction to MVVM
## The MVVM pattern (Model/View/ViewModel) was introduced by Microsoft as a variation of the more traditional MVC pattern (Model/View/Controller).
## MVVM encapsulates the application logic in a set of ViewModel classes that expose an object model that is View-friendly. Views typically focus on the user interface, and rely on bindings to connect UI elements to properties and methods in the ViewModel. This separation between logic and markup brings the following important benefits:
#### 1) Testability: The ViewModel does not contain any user interface elements, and is therefore easy to test using unit tests.

#### 2) Separation of Concerns: Business logic is written using programming languages such as C# or JavaScript. User interfaces are written using markup languages such as XAML or HTML. The skills required and tools used for each type of development are fundamentally different. Separating these elements makes team development simpler and more efficient.

#### 3) Multi-Target Applications: Encapsulating an applicationâ€™s business logic into ViewModel classes makes it easier to develop several versions of an application, targeting multiple devices. For example, one could develop a single ViewModel and different views for desktop, tablet, and phone devices.
